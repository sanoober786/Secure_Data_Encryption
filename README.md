# Secure_Data_Encryption
Secure Vault is a beautifully crafted data encryption web app built with Streamlit and Python, designed to secure sensitive information with military-grade encryption using the cryptography library (Fernet). Whether you're a student, developer, or data-conscious individual, this app allows you to safely store and retrieve confidential messages using your own unique passkey.

💡 Features
✅ AES-based encryption (via Fernet) for robust security

🔑 User-defined passkey required to encrypt & decrypt each data entry

🧠 Intelligent retry lockout after failed attempts, with reauthorization

🔐 Master login system to regain access after too many incorrect attempts

🧾 Data stored in-memory (Session-based), keeping it lightweight and private

📜 Elegant, responsive UI with modern CSS tweaks

💬 Clear feedback and alerts to guide every step of interaction

🌐 Why I Built This
This project was built as part of my learning journey at GIAIC (Governor House). It merges my interests in cybersecurity, Python development, and user experience design into one educational and practical tool. The goal? To make encryption easy, accessible, and visually appealing for everyone.
